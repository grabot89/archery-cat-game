Brief description of the game developed in 1/2 sentences:
I have called the game "Archer Cat McMeow", Its a game based on the 1980s NES game "Pooyan" mixed with the 2012 game "Battle Cats". 
The goal of the game is to pop/burst ballons with a firing arrow while avoiding an emeny who will be coming from the left side of the screen. 
In the game you have 100 arrows and three lives (displayed at bottom).

The game ends when either:
You have used up all arrows
All balloons have been burst
You have lost all 3 lives

Keystrokes/Mouse: BRIEF PLEASE
Space Bar = fire new arrow
R Key = Resets Game when game over
Up Key = Moves player position up
Down Key= Moves player position down



Known bugs/problems:

Collision detection isn't fully accurate, it is over sensitive when the enemy is close to the hero, especially when the enemy is above the hero.
On the balloons the arrow sometimes will pass through a balloon without popping it, I'm not sure is this because the program takes time to loop through all balloons
and misses the collision due to the speed of the arrow or if there is an issue with detection code.
Leaderboard changes the old score when inserting a new score so there are two scores the same instead of two different scores.
